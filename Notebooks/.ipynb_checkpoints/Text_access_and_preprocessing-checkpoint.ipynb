Today’s call is being recorded. If\\nyou have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill\\nKoefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nThank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us a little earlier than normal today for Microsoft’s\\nsecond quarter 2009 earnings conference call. We decided to align the timing of the earnings release this\\nquarter with the cost management initiatives that we announced this morning. We will talk further about\\nthese initiatives later on the call.\\nI am delighted today to be joined by Steve Ballmer, our Chief Executive Officer, as well as Chris Liddell,\\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President and Chief\\nAccounting Officer, and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. The format for today’s call will be as\\nfollows\\nChris will summarize some of the key take-aways for the quarter, as well as address the announcement\\nwe made this morning. I’ll then provide details around our second quarter results and then hand it back to\\nChris for a more detailed discussion of our business outlook, and then Steve will make some comments.\\nAfter that, we’ll take some questions.\\nPlease be aware that we filed our Form 10-Q today in conjunction with our earnings release. We have also\\nposted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared\\nremarks, as well as provided a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial\\nmeasures that we will talk about today. You can find these documents on the Investor Relations website at\\nwww.microsoft.com/msft.\\nToday’s call will be webcast live and recorded. Please be aware that if you decide to ask a question, it will\\nbe included in both our live transmission as well as any future use of the recording.

We do not undertake any duty\\nto update any forward-looking statement.\\nAnd now, I’ll return the call over to Chris.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nThanks, Bill, and again thanks to all of you for accommodating our timing changes.\\nOur second-quarter results reflect a difficult environment as the global economy continued to deteriorate\\nbeyond our expectations, particularly during the month of December. Despite this economic backdrop,\\nwe were able to grow revenue and utilize accelerated cost reductions to offset the majority of the\\nimpact to the revenue shortfall on operating income. On a segment basis, our client business, being the\\nmost severely impacted by the softening economy, declining 8% due to the significant weakness in the\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Revenue from Microsoft\\nbusiness edition and server and tools divisions were a combined $500 million or 7% driven by healthy\\ndemand from enterprise customers while the transactional aspects of these businesses were impacted by\\nlower PC and server hardware unit sales. Our online services business revenue was flat although online\\nadvertising revenue was up 7% in a tough environment, and entertainment and devices division delivered\\nrevenue above the high end of our guidance driven by a record number of consumers purchasing Xbox\\n360 consoles during the holiday season.\\nAgainst the backdrop of a deteriorating economy, we are focused on the need for fiscal discipline and on\\nexecuting in the areas we can control by managing expenses while delivering on the next wave of our\\nproduct pipeline. During the second quarter, as the economic outlook continued to slow, we accelerated\\nour expense reduction plan. These actions allowed us to deliver operating expenses in the second quarter\\nof $600 million below our October forecast. However, today we have also announced steps we will take to\\nfurther manage our cost structure. These steps include a reduction in headcount related costs, including\\nplans to reduce up to 5,000 positions in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, finance,\\nlegal, human resources and IT over the next 18 months, of which 1,400 are effected today. There will\\nbe no pay raises next fiscal year. We have plans to significantly reduce our window and contingent staff\\nexpenses. We’ll also be looking for reductions in marketing expenses, reduced capital expenditure and\\nfacility costs, as well as tighter discretionary spending, including significantly reduced travel related\\nexpenses.\\nThe cumulative result of these actions taken during the quarter and those announced today will result\\nin operating expense savings of $1.5 billion and capital expenditure savings of $700 million lower in this\\nfiscal year 2009 than assumed in our July guidance. Lastly, we plan to manage operating expenses broadly\\nflat in the fiscal year 2010 and capital expenditure to be lower year over year. While we are managing\\nour expenses tightly, we continue investing in key strategic opportunities which will fuel the future growth\\nof the company. We have a strong product pipeline and are bringing to market a number of significant\\nproduct releases over the next two calendar years.\\nWith those high level themes, I will turn the call over to Bill for more details on the second quarter.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nThanks Chris. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points followed by revenue\\nperformance for each of the business units. Then I’ll review the rest of the income statement. All growth\\ncomparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise noted.\\nRevenue grew 2% to $16.6 billion, which was below our low end guidance as the economic environment\\nweakened further than we expected, particularly in the month of December. Our mix of product billings\\nwas approximately 30% from OEMs, 25% from multi year licensing agreements, 20% from license only\\nsales, and the balance from our other businesses. Despite the broad economic weakness, the annuity\\nportion of our volume licensing business remains healthy and increased one percentage point in our billing\\nmix. Enterprise agreements renewal rates were in line with historical trends. Unearned revenue grew over\\n7% to $13.1 billion but was down sequentially. Our contracted not billed balance increased 10% year\\nover year but was slightly down on a sequential basis remaining at over $13 billion. When taken together\\nwith reported revenues, total bookings for the company declined 10% this quarter, reflecting the general\\neconomic weakness, primarily in our non-annuity business. Overall, changes in foreign exchange rates\\nadded about 1 percentage point to our revenue growth.\\nNow I’ll provide revenue details by business segment starting with Windows clients. Client revenue\\ndeclined 8% to $4.0 billion. I will review the main drivers that contributed to this performance beginning\\nwith an overview of the PC market. We estimate that the PC market for the quarter was approximately\\nflat year over year, well short of our forecast of 10% to 12% growth as the PC market weakened much\\nmore quickly and severely than expected. Adding a bit more color, traditional PCs declined almost 10%\\nwith weakness in both consumer and business PCs. This was partially offset by incremental growth in the\\nnew net books category. During the quarter, our windows OEM license units declined by 1%. OEM revenue\\nwas 12% lower year over year driven primarily by the dynamics of the underlying PC market. Specifically,\\nthe decline in traditional PC sales drove double digit declines in business and consumer premium SKUs.\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2009 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2009\\n\\nThis impact was partially offset by strong growth in our net books offering. Our attach rates were under\\npressure during the quarter, but we didn’t experience a material change versus historical rates. Our net\\nbook attach rate now exceed 80% as customers are clearly opting for the value Windows provides.\\nWe estimate that we lost about two percentage points of growth due to the channel holding lower\\nthan historical level of inventory. The commercial and retail portion of the client business grew 19%\\nas it benefited from continued adoption of Windows Vista in the enterprise. On the product front, our\\nengineering team reached a major milestone with the delivery of the public beta of Windows 7, which has\\nreceived great reviews today. We remain very positive about the client product pipeline and its inability\\nto drive long-term growth. Servers and tools revenue grew 15% to $3.7 billion despite a decline in the\\nserver hardware market. This achievement marks the businesses 26th consecutive quarter of double-digit\\ngrowth. Annuity licensing continued to grow faster than non annuity licensing. The momentum of SQL\\nServer 2008 and our Hyper-V virtualization helped drive Windows server sales and increase our systems\\ncenter management tools attach rate, thus allowing us to grow our revenue per server. As a result, servers\\nand tools continued to grow faster than the hardware market.\\nDemand for our consulting and support services to deploy Microsoft technology remains strong, driving\\nrevenue growth at 16%. On the product side, the server and tools business division made significant\\nproduct development progress. Released to beta, Windows Server 2008 R2 will add the Live migration\\nfeature to Hyper-V further enhancing our virtualization offering. At the Professional Developers Conference\\nin October, we provided a preview to Windows Azure, our cloud based services platform. The Azure\\nservices platform hosted Microsoft data centers, provides an operating system, and a set of developers\\nservices that can be used to build new applications to run from the cloud or enhance existing applications\\nwith cloud based capabilities. This architecture gives developers the choice to build web applications,\\napplications running on connected devices, PCs, servers or hybrid solutions, while using the same tools\\nthey use today.\\nThe online services business revenue was relatively flat at $866 million. Online advertising revenue\\ngrew 7%. Search revenue grow double digits while display revenue grew slower in a weak ad spending\\nmarket. We continue to see healthy growth in our traffic with page views and query searches both up on\\na sequential and year over year basis. In the online services business, we recently announced important\\npartnerships with Dell, Verizon, and Sun Microsystems, and released a new suite of Windows Live services.\\nWe remain committed to the benefit that a strong online services business will bring to Microsoft.\\nMicrosoft businesses division revenue was up 1% to $4.9 billion. Business revenue grew 7%, driven by\\ncontinued strength of the annuity business across Office, SharePoint and Client Access licenses suites,\\nand benefited from strong deferred revenue recognition. Non annuity revenue declined on the weakness\\nin the mid market, small medium business and consumer segments. Specifically consumer revenue\\ndeclined 23% driven by the weakness in the core PC market, a mix shift to lower price SKUs and inventory\\nreductions from Q1. From a product perspective, SharePoint, Office Communication Server and CRM, all\\ngrew at double-digit rates. We made significant progress against the product pipeline by releasing final\\nversions of Exchange Online and SharePoint Online.\\nIn October at PDC we demonstrated our Office 14 web application which will enable the rich and familiar\\noffice experiences through the browser. Entertainment and devices division revenue grew 3% to $3.2\\nbillion. A record 6 million consoles were sold in the quarter growing over 41%. In Europe, Xbox 360 sales\\nnearly doubled those of previous holiday season. Based on US NPD numbers released last week, Xbox 360\\noutsold PS3 two one. We continue to lead the industry with out software attach ratio of 8.1. During the\\nquarter, we also launched the new Xbox Experience which has been received extremely well. The software\\nupdate has given our customers a new upgraded experience that broadens its appeal and increases the\\nvalue and durability of the platform to customers and Microsoft. Xbox Live membership has grown 70%\\nfrom last year to 17 million members.\\nNow for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was $3.9 billion, increasing as a percentage\\nof revenue two percentage points to 23.5%. Cost of goods sold growth was driven by higher Xbox\\n360 console volumes, increased data center and traffic acquisition cost in the online services business\\nand growth in enterprise services. Operating expenses were $6.8 billion, over $600 million less than\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2009 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2009\\n\\nwas assumed in our low end guidance. This represents a significant slowing in the operating expense\\ngrowth rate. Savings included marketing, vendor, people and general and administrative expense. As a\\nconsequence, operating income, which was $5.9 billion was only $174 million below guidance despite\\nrevenue being $712 million below guidance. Other income and expenses was a loss of approximately $300\\nmillion for the quarter, driven by currency valuations declines on unhedged portions of the balance sheet\\nand investment impairments, offset by dividends, interest and net recognized gains on investments sold.\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, half a percentage point lower than guidance, driven by an\\nearnings mix increase in lower tax jurisdictions. During the quarter, we repurchased 94 million shares or\\nover $2.2 billion of company stock. We also paid out about $1.2 billion in dividend to shareholders. Diluted\\nshares outstanding were 8.9 billion, down 6.2% from the prior year as a result of the share repurchases.\\nEarnings per share were $0.47 representing a decline of 6%.\\nAs Chris noted earlier, the business environment made for a challenging quarter, but we feel positively\\nabout our quick response in managing expenses to mitigate the impact as much as possible. With that let\\nme turn it back to Chris, who will provide you with more insight into our business outlook.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nI am going to spend my remaining time talking about the balance of fiscal 2009. Clearly the volatility in\\nthe macro economic climate created a great degree of uncertainty in the second half of our fiscal year,\\nand in particular conditions progressively worsened throughout the second quarter, creating a broader\\nthe normal range of possible extrapolations looking forward. So given that we expect macroeconomic\\nconditions to be the most important variable in predicting our results in the second half, we’re not\\nproviding quantitative revenue or earnings per share guidance at this time.\\nWe will however provide you with the framework to help you think about the drivers for our business. I’ll\\nstart with revenue, beginning with clients. The PC market is clearly the key driver of client revenue and it\\nis likely to remain weak over the second half of our fiscal year, with market trends similar to or potentially\\nweaker than the second quarter, especially in the traditional PC market, excluding the Xbox. Offsetting\\nthat partially, the net books mix of total PCs will likely follow similar trends to Q2, with continued strong\\nWindows attach on net books contributing to overall Windows revenue. However, as the economy slows,\\ncontinued inventory contraction and pressure on attach rates would negatively impact revenue growth\\nin the second half. So overall we expect client revenue to perform broadly in line with the traditional PC\\nmarket.\\nThe Microsoft business division, I will speak to the three main drivers for the business. Consumer\\nrevenue which makes up about 20% of the divisional revenue will be impacted by the declines of the\\ntraditional or non net book PC market, in addition to further channel contraction. Transactional licensing\\nsales to business customers which make up about 25% of the divisional revenue should generally align\\nto the business PC hardware market which may continue to decline in the second half. Finally, the\\nremaining annuity licensing portion of MBD revenue which makes up approximately 35% is likely to\\nremain somewhat insulated from macro trends and grow faster than IT spending due to the strength of\\nthe businesses like SharePoint, unified communications, while it could face pressure due to lengthening\\nsales cycle.\\nThe sever and tools segment has many of the same drivers as the business division. The OEM and\\ntransactional licensing business customers, which is approximately 35% of the business, should generally\\nalign for the server hardware market which at this time of the year and we expect will decline over the\\nsecond half of the year. The remaining annuity licensing and enterprise services portion of the business\\nwill likely continue to grow faster than IT spending based on the strength of our product portfolio and\\nbusiness model but also could face some pressure due to lengthening sales cycle. Overseas revenue\\nshould followed similar trends to what was experienced in the second quarter with advertising spending\\nwill likely remain weak until the economy starts turning. This is particular for the display advertising\\nportion of our business where we expect monetization rates across industry to continue to worsen. Also\\nkeep in mind that the ongoing expected decline is our XS business worldwide on the overall growth of the\\nsegment. Additionally, we would expect a head wind from the impact of foreign currency in the second half\\nof the year, given the high proportion of revenue that comes from the international market.\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2009 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2009\\n\\nThe entertainment and devices division, is highly dependent on consumer spending and while we feel good\\nabout the first half results, a shrinking consumer spending environment would weight on the segment\\nresults in the second half. Consolidated revenue will likely decline as a result of really pricing actions.\\nAttach revenue may also slow due to contracting consumer spending and moderating attach rates. The\\nother software and virtual portions of our business should follow the underlying PC market in the second\\nhalf.\\nWith that primer to assess our revenue prospects, let me move to our outlook on expenses. The economy\\nis clearly deteriorated more than we expected and we have responded to this environment by taking\\nfurther actions to reduce expenses and to prioritize our efforts. We have initiated a number of cost savings\\nwhich will layer in progressively over this fiscal year. As a result of these actions, we have now said\\nfiscal 2009 operating expenses of approximately $27.4 billion. Going forward, we expect to maintain our\\noperating expense broadly flat in fiscal year 2010.\\nMoving to the other drivers of earnings per share, we continue to experience - we continue to expect an\\neffective tax rate of 26.5% for the year. Other income might be negatively affected by further market\\nmovements. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, through stock repurchases over\\nthe long-term, given the increased uncertainty in the current market, repurchase activity will slow in the\\nsecond half of fiscal 2009.\\nWith those overall comments and outlook, I would now like to hand the call over to Steve, so he can share\\nhis perspectives before we take your questions.\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nThanks Chris. We are certainly in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime set of economic conditions. The\\nperspective I would bring is not one of recession, what I would say rather is the economy is resetting to\\na lower level of business and consumer spending, that is based largely on the reduced leveraged in the\\neconomy. Consumers cannot refinance their homes, don’t have that extra money to buy discretionary\\nsecond and third PCs. Business in the business market, we certainly see a production in capital expense\\nbased upon lack of leverage in business conditions. IT spending represents about 50% of US business\\ncapital spend. And so neither the consumer nor the business side of the technology industry is immune to\\nthese economic conditions. As a participant in this market that at least in some areas like a client business\\nhas a very significant market share, you certainly feel the overall market impact most clearly.\\nIn these times, I think there is three things to focus in on, and not surprisingly two of them are very\\nsimilar to things we focusing in on everyday. The three things are, number one, innovation, which I will\\ntalk about; number two is market share, because even in the market that is suffering, share increases\\ntried revenue growth. We are always focused on share but particularly now. And number three is efficiency\\nand effective resource prioritization and allocation which is where I want to start and one where we\\nperhaps spent a little less time with you historically.\\nWe are long-term and I’ll come back to this. We’ll remain incredibly positive on Microsoft, the technology\\nindustry, the opportunity for innovation, and yet now it’s certainly the time to ask critically, which of our\\ninvestments should we prioritize, and how can we get more efficient? Is the same amount of work done,\\nif you will, for less. We have been an exercise and continue through an exercise looking at work processes\\nand driving that efficiency, rightsizing and prioritizing some of our investments, and we have got to take\\na number of actions, we are taking a number of actions to in some sense manage our cost base. Our cost\\nbase has grown. As many of you know significantly over the last few years. And while as Chris said, we\\ndon’t plan on shrinking it in FT10, we are really putting the brakes on at a new level and quite significantly\\nputting the brakes on. With that said, we’re going to continue to invest in important areas of opportunity\\nfor the company and so even while we take out the 5000 jobs, we will also be adding a few thousand\\njobs back in areas like search, where we continue to see incredible opportunity to do good work. So we\\nwill take out, put back in, but in aggregate manage expenses consistent with the comments Chris had a\\nchance to make.\\nIn terms of market share, I think we have some great opportunities. Bill talked about the performance\\nof the Xbox, sold over 5 million Windows mobile units this quarter, which was great, we have got a lot of\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2009 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2009\\n\\nopportunity in search, we are glad to have search volume up so significantly for us this quarter. Our server\\nand tools business reflects our ongoing market share improvement basically in both Windows Server\\nand in our Sequel business. You’ll see us continue to invest particularly in Web Servers and technical\\ncomputing as we move forward. In the client business, we sold north of 50 million units of Windows\\nand that another big chunk. Unfortunately probably got used without pay, but not paid for, and yet we\\nlost maybe a point of share of that, so 2.5 million during the same period. We have big plans there with\\nWindows 7 and everything that we have coming forward. And certainly in this economic climate, with\\nthe kind of price premiums that people pay for Macintoshes versus PCs, I think will be looked at farmer\\ncritically by customers as a number of reviewers have started to note. In the case of net books, we have\\ngotten from no share to as the guys said over 80% share and climbing. It is a fully interesting topic in and\\nof itself. Our business with the consumer market, unit volumes up dramatically year-on-year, over 14%,\\nwhich is the business people think where we have high share, we have a great opportunity. So a lot of\\nfocus in the enterprise space, in the online space, in the entertainment area, in the client area. There are\\na lot of opportunities to work market share, both from product development standpoint and from an sales\\nand marketing perspective.\\nOur product pipeline and the work we are doing in innovation, I am excited about it. We have had first\\nlook on Windows 7, we had good market reaction to Windows Azure, a new version of Office, Office\\n14. I am excited to be out in next year or so. Windows Server 2008 Release 2 builds on the strength of\\nWindows Server. We have certainly got our work cut out for us. There are businesses where we have got\\na lot of work to do, where we don’t have leading positions, and there is some businesses where we’ve got\\nleading positions, which have phenomenal new products to come. But we will continue to invest strongly in\\nR&D, that get very well funded in the operating expense strategy that Chris talked about, but at the same\\ntime, we are prioritizing, we are focusing on the most important stuff as we go forward.\\nCertainly the size and scope of this economic dislocation is unprecedented and may delay some technology\\nadoption in the industry at large. I don’t think there is any stopping, forward march of our industry or\\nMicrosoft. And in the long run, let us call it the pause that the economy is imposing on our industry, it\\nwill certainly just be that. It is a pause and will be renewed strong growth in the technology industry\\noverall, certainly at Microsoft. And we’re focused, we are focused on efficiency, on market share, and on\\nrenovation as we drive forward.\\nAnd with that, I am going to hand things back over to Bill so that we can start taking some of your\\nquestions.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nThanks Steve. Let’s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people\\nas possible, so please avoid multipart questions, and I will strictly limit you to just one question.

And our first question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup.\\n<strong>Brent Thill - Citigroup</strong>\\nThanks. Good morning. If your fiscal 2009 guidance holds, this will be the fourth consecutive year of\\noperating margin decline. Do you think you're taking quick enough action to realign the business to this\\nlower demand environment?\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nYes, Brent. We believe certainly taking as you saw $600 million worth of costs out the second quarter,\\nwhich is almost 10% of our cost base for the quarter, was very prompt action. And if you look at $1.5\\nbillion dollars for this year as well, that we believed in the context of a deteriorating economic really\\naccelerated December. So we're talking about reacting to the last and particular months to six weeks\\nor so of economic data. We think the actions we took were actually quite very fast and appropriate for\\nthat now. I agree with the margin comment, but clearly also the mix of our business is changing quite\\nsignificantly as well. So as we sit here today, based on the facts that we have seen in particular over the\\nlast few weeks, we think we have taken the right degree of action in terms of reducing the cost base but\\ncontinuing to still invest against the revenue that we see coming forward.\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nI think one thing you have to understand is with our margin structure i.e. with high margins as a\\npercentage of revenue, we're going to be far more volatile both on the upside and on the downside\\ndue to fluctuations in revenue. And unlike a company that is sort of more about manufacturing where\\neverything kind of scales with volume, we have a much larger fixed costs chunk. And on the upside,\\nwhen revenue goes strong, it’s a chance to increase margins, but when revenue is weaker, it is likely that\\nmargin percentages will decline.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nAnd when you look at the initiatives we have taken, depending on the item you are talking about, whether\\nit's from people to things like travel expenses to Window cost, we're taking out somewhere between 5%\\nand 15% of the cost line that we’re talking about, which we think in this environment relative to the reset\\nin the economy is broadly the right level.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nThanks. Next question?\\n<strong>Operator</strong>\\nAnd the next question comes from the Heather Bellini with UBS.\\n<strong>Heather Bellini - UBS</strong>\\nHi, good morning. You mentioned that you are laying of 5,000 people. I'm wondering if all of those are\\nMicrosoft employees or there are also outside contractors that work at Microsoft that you're not including\\nin that total? And I guess along that line, are you including cash severance charges that you are going to\\ntake for the reductions in force, are you including that in your operating expense guidance for fiscal year\\n2009? Thank you.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2009 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2009\\n\\nYes, Heather. The outside contractors are not included in that number, and we will be certainly looking to\\nreduce that cost line, probably in proportion by more than what we are talking about in terms of internal\\npeople. So the 5,000 jobs we talk about are entirely Microsoft related.\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nIt is not really five - I mean let me make sure the math is clear. We may eliminate up to 5,000 jobs, but\\nwe are also adding a few thousand jobs.\\n<strong>Heather Bellini - UBS</strong>\\n<strong>Yes. No, I think we all assumed that, that net-net it is going to be less than 5.000.</strong>\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nand we're talking here now privately about operating expense head count as opposed to cost of goods,\\nwhich varies in its own criteria. So on the operating expense line, I expect this to been down more like a\\nnet sort of 2,000 to 3,000.\\n<strong>Heather Bellini - UBS</strong>\\nRight. Then to Chris’ point, it looks like you will end up cutting more outside contractors than the 5,000, or\\nthan the 2,000 to 3,000 you just mentioned?\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nYes, those numbers all internal people, Heather. The external contractors I guess if we think about more in\\nterms of the dollars that we spent overall, that's on top of the numbers that we are talking about and that\\ncould be down up to 15%.\\n<strong>Heather Bellini - UBS</strong>\\nOkay. And then the cash severance charge part?\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nThe cash severance charge is not included in the operating expense that we are talking about. It will not\\n- we are looking at the number and it obviously depends on the final number that we talk about with\\npeople, but we will call that out separately in the third quarter for the 1,400 people that we are talking\\nabout today, and then I guess that as other people leave the company, we will look at the charge at that\\ntime.\\n<strong>Heather Bellini - UBS</strong>\\nOkay, thank you.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nLet's go to the next question please.\\n<strong>Operator</strong>\\n<strong>Next is Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.</strong>\\n<strong>Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley</strong>\\nGood morning. My first question is about the buyback, is the slowing of buyback activity principally related\\nto just capital preservation, or do you see an opportunity to maybe be more aggressive on the M&A side\\ngiven some of the depressed valuations? And then just secondarily can you walk us through maybe even\\nsome high-level thoughts on how you view the PC market? I know you are not giving explicit guidance,\\nbut what your expectations are for piracy, any just kind of guidelines for how we should be thinking about\\nPC growth in the back half of the year? Thanks.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2009 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2009\\n\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nSure. On the buyback, it is both the factors that you mentioned. Certainly capital preservation in this\\nenvironment is more important than it's ever been. On the acquisition side, clearly the opportunity to\\nbuy shares is very good. And Microsoft, having said that, the opportunity to buy other companies has\\nprobably never been better relative to their prices. Having said that, I wouldn't expect M&A activity to be\\nparticularly significant in the second half of the year, simply because I don't think the market generally\\nhas yet lowered their expectations to the new level of prices we're talking about. So we will continue to\\nbuy some small medium-sized businesses as we normally do. Prices are certainly coming down and that's\\nan opportunity from our point of view, but I think the level of activity will be relatively low, certainly in\\nthe next quarter or two. But the opportunity there afterwards to buy companies, again generally speaking\\nthe small and medium sized, I think is going to be very good and that's part of thinking about why we're\\ntrying to retain that capital and retain our powder as much as possible. On the PC market, you are right,\\nwe're not giving guidance. I gave some directional thoughts. We aren’t predicting any macro economic\\nrather than Microsoft specific factors are really going to drive the PC market over the next six months. But\\nyou have so realistically the base cases for continuation or even possibly a slight deterioration from the\\nsecond quarter in what we described the traditional PC market.\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nIt is worth remembering the market has let me just say broadly speaking four pieces to it. Business PCs,\\nfor which we receive our highest royalty, consumer PCs, net book, net book PCs, and then let's just say\\neverything in emerging markets, of which China is half of that. And I mentioned that because we have\\ndifferent pricing in each and we have particularly in the last one we have some high piracy dynamics,\\nwhich affect us. PC market overall is probably strongest today in emerging markets, second strongest in\\nthe net books, third strongest in home PCs, and weakest in business PCs, because that's where - it is a\\nplace where businesses will say, we will just extend the refresh cycle. So our economic drivers don't look\\nlike overall PC market, they look like the components, and unfortunately right now we are in let’s say\\ntough win relative even to the mix.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nAnd the other thing I would say, and I think this is generic to all the businesses, is we saw quite a different\\nshape in the quarter. I mean December in particular was relatively weak inside the quarter. October\\ntrading conditions were generally speaking in line with our expectations, the first half of November\\nwas, and we like I think like most companies out there saw the weakness really started to set in in late\\nNovember and through December. So to some extent, at the end of the year, we extrapolate quarter\\noverall or the conditions that we and most companies saw in December, as to what sort of an environment\\nwe’d see in the first half, and that creates if you like the bookings of expectations, but those are quite\\nwide. If you extrapolate the quarter overall, or extrapolate the December, you get quite different answers,\\nand that's true of the PC market, also true for business overall.\\n<strong>Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley</strong>\\nGood color, thank you.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nLet's go to the next question.\\n<strong>Operator</strong>\\nAnd next is Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.\\n<strong>Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs</strong>\\n<strong>Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow up there on the PC growth rate\\nversus Microsoft growth rate. Steve, I understand your point about your oriented away from maybe some\\n- or you don't make as much money on some of the segments that are growing fastest. The delta we saw\\nthis quarter of about 8%, is that a reasonable delta to think about going forward, particularly you have a\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2009 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2009\\n\\nsense of how inventory noise was in the quarter? Does that dive back and maybe close the delta or should\\nwe keep thinking about it about an 8% delta?</strong>\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nI don’t know that you can pick any magic number because the dynamic - unfortunately, the dynamics shift\\nfairly quickly. My guess is, wherever businesses are going to reset, that will reset more quickly than where\\nthe consumer will wind up resetting to. The consumer will be more volatile. Our business customers will go\\nthrough one round of thinking rethinking budgets, and then they will reset it at a new level. And so I think\\nwe are going to see more dynamism unfortunately in that number.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nYes, Sarah, if I add a little bit color on that, and there are more - as Steve say, there are more moving\\npieces this quarter than there are normally, but if I try and simplify it a little bit, if you take what we\\ndescribed as our traditional PC market, which is the mixture of the business and consumer that Steve just\\nmentioned, and take that as one growth rate, net books will clearly grow in excess of that and give us a\\nlittle bit of a revenue uplift. We will see probably some inventory contractions. Attach rates on average are\\nprobably going to be much the same, we might lose some in the traditional market but gain a bit on the\\nnet books side, and then we will see our traditional shift to emerging markets, although interestingly they\\nhave slowed more than traditional markets inside the quarter. You throw all those things together and we\\nwould next their revenue decline to be broadly in line with the growth rate from the traditional PC market,\\nso all the other pluses and minuses will generally speaking cancel themselves out.\\n<strong>Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs</strong>\\nBut not as big a delta as we saw this quarter?\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nRelative to the PC market, in fact, we saw it’s about the same. So the traditional PC market we think\\nshrinks somewhere between 7% and 10% in the quarter and our revenue for the client business was down\\naround 8%, so in that range. So that sort of trimmed based on the set of factors which Steve mentioned\\nare moving quite quickly, but if I hold relative to the second quarter, you're probably going to see that\\nsame overall trend in the back half .\\n<strong>Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs</strong>\\nThank you.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nThanks. Operator, next question?\\n<strong>Operator</strong>\\n<strong>Next is Karl Sharingan [ph] from Bank of America.</strong>\\n<strong>Karl Sharingan - Bank of America</strong>\\nHi. Thank you very much. Steve, since we have you on the line, just thought I’d ask you a question on\\nthe headcount reduction. You pointed out the consumer spending and business spending has contracted\\npretty sharply and yet we are talking about a 5,000 person headcount reduction here which still leaves\\nthe operating expenses from this fiscal 2009 up about 10% despite the revenue growth of what looks to\\nbe about a percent or so? So I'm wondering what your thoughts are, what are your assumptions? I mean\\nit looks like you're factoring in some sort of a rebound, maybe on 12 months, 15 months? Certainly you\\ndon't want to lay -off a lot of people if you end up having to hire them back when the economy starts to\\nturn. I'm just wondering if that's the way you are thinking about it, or are you actually open to revisiting\\nthe cost structure if indeed the economic conditions continue to act the way that you portrait, that is a\\nvastly lower level of consumer and business spending on technology? Are you open to another round of\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2009 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2009\\n\\ncuts if you have too to bring the OpEx in line with net revenue growth that we are looking at in 2009 and\\n2010?\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nWell, no. I would say actually a couple of things. I don't know about that. We are not used to down\\nmarkets. So PC market is traditional market as Chris call them, is down 7, or whatever it is, 8% or so.\\nBut 8% is vast, something that's always grown a lot. But maybe some of your attributes, I would modify\\nslightly. We are certainly dealing with unprecedented grounds. Our model is not for a quick rebound. Our\\nmodel is things go down, as I said, and they reset. The economy shrinks and then it doesn't rebound,\\nit builds from a lower base effectively. So that kind of building in our work on costs overall reflects that\\nmodel. So no, I'm not expecting a balance. And when we did our resizing, we did our resizing with an\\neye both towards margin, total profit, shareholders short-term and long-term investment in the growth\\nopportunities that we see. So no, I would say that if the economy stays down and then builds slowly,\\nwe're probably at about the expense base, we will stay at about the expense base that Chris talked about.\\nYou can't tell, the economy could also get a whole lot worse, it could get a whole lot better, but our basic\\nview is that things go down, they are down for a while, a year or two years, I don't know what it will be,\\nand then start to build back again. That's kind of the basic planning model behind this resizing of our\\ncost base. You could say that means you could see lower total profit percent margin and that's certainly\\npossible.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nNext question.\\n<strong>Operator</strong>\\nAnd next is Philip Winslow from Credit Suisse.\\n<strong>Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse</strong>\\nHi, guys. I just wanted to dig into the severance charges for a minute, you mentioned that you are\\nclearing those in your GAAP OpEx guidance, what level would you expect that to be in the second half of\\nthis year?\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nYes. I said just to be clear, that it wasn't in the number of 27.4 that I mentioned, so it would be on top\\nof that. And we’d expect it to be several tens of millions, but less than 100 million to give you an order\\nof magnitude, and it’s going to depend entirely on the number of people that we talk about, yes, the\\nindividual circumstances. So I can't give you an exact number, but that's the order of magnitude.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nNext question operator.\\n<strong>Operator</strong>\\nAnd next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.\\n<strong>Brad Reback - Oppenheimer</strong>\\nHi guys. How are you?\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nGood.\\n<strong>Brad Reback - Oppenheimer</strong>\\nI'm a little confused. If, Chris, as you talk about on the share repurchase side, slowing it down in the\\nsecond half of the year, but on the other side when we are talking about $1.5 billion cost coming out over\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2009 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2009\\n\\nthe next 18 months, clearly it is still a very valuable franchise with a lot of cash flow, why not take this\\nopportunity to buy back probably the best investment there is at least from your perspective?\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nYes. My comments were certainly from the - over the long term, we remain committed to the buyback\\nactivity. The buyback activity in the first half was actually very high. All I did was signal that we expect in\\nthe second half that will moderate from that level. We continue to be a net buyer of our shares absolutely.\\nDo we think liquidity in the current environment, certainly until we get a clearer pattern on economic\\nactivity overall. Is it a premium? Yes, I do. Do I think there's going to be some outstanding opportunities\\nover the medium term to potentially buy some other companies that we have looked at? I’ll mitigate that\\nby saying small to medium, yes, I do. So the opportunity cost of buying our shares has also gone up as\\nwell as the price going down. We are just trying to balance those factors, but we certainly are not talking\\nabout getting out of buyback activity as a general concept.\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nI will remind you that there was a time when tendered our shares at 25 bucks because they looked super\\ncheap for us. That we could - I mean it is hard to know what the underlying market is going to do, and\\nasset values, and we just think it makes sense to keep a little bit more liquid for a while.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nBut also be consistent on this, we try not to tell you in advance what we are doing on the buyback activity.\\nWe do that in the quarter, all I'm doing is giving you a directional trend.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nNext question operator.\\n<strong>Operator</strong>\\nAnd next is John Difucci with JPMorgan.\\n<strong>John Difucci - JPMorgan</strong>\\nThank you. Guys, can you just help me a little bit here in reconciling sort of a follow-up to some of the\\nother questions, because you're talking about the declining environment actually meaning going down,\\nand the uncertainty going forward, and you're resetting expense to reflect this. But your new guidance for\\noperating expenses is still up meaningfully in the second half year over year when you adjust for the third\\nquarter charge last year. And it just if you really think things are - and they obviously are, we all know\\nthey are tough out there, and today it looks like it's coming down, it is getting worse year over year, but\\nyour expenses, you're laying out some people, no one like to see anybody get laid of, I am sure you don’t,\\nwe don’t, but net 2,000 to 3000 out of 91,000 or whatever you have, are you really resetting expenses to\\nreflect what is out there?\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nBear in mind of course in the year, half of the year has already gone, and we are reacting to a situation, as\\nI say, and in particular, it’s in the back half of the quarter. So -\\n<strong>John Difucci - JPMorgan</strong>\\nThis is year over year for just the second half, your expenses are still up, your operating expenses are still\\ngoing to be if you exclude the third quarter last year that 1.35 fine, so it is - I'm sorry, go ahead, Chris.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nYour point is valid, and I am very happy to address that. What I described act as changing the momentum\\nof our expense base going forward, but clearly we already have things in the pipeline and people who\\nare employed, who we have to bear the expense of. So we are talking about a plan that stretches out\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

So these things are layering in over time and are in response - you remember I talked about\\nit at the last call, we are taking a set of initiatives in that quarter, and we said - I said at the time that if\\nthings got worse, we will probably look to do more. Things did get worse, and we did do more. So we're\\ntalking about layering in as we see economic conditions change. So, yes, we would all like to be able to\\ntake things out instantaneously. The reality is that we can't do that as quickly as we would like, but you\\nwill see us take action that have an impact over the next few months.\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nOperator, next question.\\n<strong>Operator</strong>\\nAnd next is Todd Raker from Deutsche Bank.\\n<strong>Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank</strong>\\nThanks guys. Chris, I was wondering if you look at the overall corporation, could you give us a sense in\\nterms of how kind of consumer versus transactional business versus annuity breaks out? And what's the\\nrisk as we look at this spending environment as the annuity business starts to show some dramatic impact\\nover the next kind of six to 18 months?\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nThe annuity business was good in the first quarter and the second quarter, so that’s certainly one of the\\nstrengths of that business model is the relative insulation of our results from as a result of the annuity\\nbusiness, that's a very good point. Non annuity business shrink during the second quarter, annuity\\nbusiness actually, the revenue associated with annuity business actually grew. So it is providing us some\\ndegree of insulation and we're talking about results obviously that are lower than expectations, but to just\\nkeep that in context, we still grew revenue 2% in probably the worst environment that we have seen. Part\\nof the reason for that was the strength of annuity. Over the time, and in particular if we see the business\\nenvironment deteriorate in the second half, clearly that annuity business will slow. Having said that, our\\nre-signing rates inside the enterprises was broadly in line with historic rates. Billings were broadly flat in\\nthe annuity area year over year, so they aren’t growing as fast as they would, but they weren’t declining\\neither. They were broadly flat. We have a very big second half from a billings perspective, so we have\\nthe opportunity actually to put some more money back in the bank. So on that side of the business,\\ncertainly stronger historically, and that will provide us some degree of cushion as we go through the next\\nsix months to 12 months.\\n<strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>\\nThe way I would characterize it is it is a bit of a dance oscillation. We are actually recognizing now\\ncontracts signed two or three years ago. The contracts we are re-signing contracts - sometimes we're re-\\nsigning contracts with companies that have less blades, they have less PCs, so even if they are renewing\\ntheir contracts, they may not be renewing at the same dollar value that the contracts expire at. The effect\\nof that event shows up in other revenue and all that stuff in the books. But from a net income, it takes\\nlonger. So if we stay in this cycle and there is fewer people employed in the US, eventually that does ripple\\nthrough to the annuity business also.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\nBut non annuity is likely to be more volatile and more negative than the annuity which is likely to provide,\\nas Steve says, it is likely to lower the oscillation of revenue overall.\\n<strong>Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank</strong>\\nAnd any rough -\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

But it generally varies between 30% and 40% of our revenue.\\n<strong>Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank</strong>\\nOkay, thank guys.\\n<strong>Chris Liddell</strong>\\n<strong>That's the annuity side of 30% of 40%.</strong>\\n<strong>Bill Koefoed</strong>\\nNext question operator.\\n<strong>Operator</strong>\\nAnd our next question comes from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.\\n<strong>Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets</strong>\\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Steve, can you talk about as you look at the portfolio of\\nbusiness you have and obviously if you go through this economy the way it is, I mean when or if do\\nyou think you and the Board would take action to review your portfolio and made a strategic decision to\\npossibly divest off certain assets or technologies, any color around the strategy in particular would be\\nhelpful?
