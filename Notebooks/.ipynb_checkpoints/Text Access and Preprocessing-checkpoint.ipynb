       "'MICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nPresentation\\n\\nOperator\\nGreetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call.\\n[Operator Instructions] . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to\\nintroduce your host, Chris Suh, with -- Manager -- General Manager, Investor Relations for Microsoft.\\nThank you, Chris. You may begin.\\nChris Suh\\nGeneral Manager of Cloud & Enterprise Finance\\nThank you, operator. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, is our financial summary slide deck, which\\nis intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and\\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\\nAs a reminder, we will post today\\'s prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until\\nthe complete transcript is available. Today\\'s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question,\\nit will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can\\nreplay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 23, 2015.\\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other\\nstatements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions\\nthat are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors\\ndiscussed in today\\'s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the\\nRisk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and\\nExchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.\\nBefore I hand the call over to Amy, please keep in mind that all growth comparisons we make on the call\\ntoday will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted\\nnumbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year\\'s revenue\\ndeferrals and recognitions related to Windows, Office and Xbox video games.\\nAs a reminder, with our new segment reporting structure, we have consolidated adjustments of this nature\\ninto corporate and other to provide better comparability of operating results. You can find details of the\\nadjustments and the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our\\nfinancial summary slide deck.\\nAnd with that, I\\'ll turn it over to Amy.\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThank you, Chris. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. As I look back on the quarter, I\\nam pleased with the results as we exceeded our expected revenue growth while continuing to maintain our\\nfocus on improved execution and cost management.\\nOur Devices and Consumer segment had a very good quarter and grew 13% with the successful holiday.\\nOur Commercial segment had another great quarter and grew 10% to over $12 billion as we continue to\\ndeliver on our differentiated cloud strategy. We performed well this quarter and you see it in our financial\\nresults.\\nThis holiday we continued to make significant progress in the consumer space, headlined by Xbox One,\\nwhich launched in 13 markets and sold in 3.9 million units in just over 5 weeks. According to NPD group\\nfigures, Xbox One was the leading console in the U.S. for the month of December, which was its first full\\nmonth in market. When adding in Xbox 360, which held the third spot, Xbox led the U.S. market with\\n46% share in December. We are excited for this enthusiastic response from our loyal customers and are\\nworking to increase the availability of Xbox One.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nWith Surface, demand continued to grow, benefiting from improved execution at retail and favorable\\nreviews of the new Surface devices. Sequentially, both units and revenue more than doubled this quarter,\\nwith customers recognizing Surface\\'s differentiated value proposition as one device for everything in their\\nlife. We feel good about the progress we have made over the past couple of quarters and are enthusiastic\\nabout the overall opportunity ahead with Surface.\\nThe Windows ecosystem as a whole is also making important progress. Earlier this fall we launched\\nWindows 8.1 which enabled smarter, faster and more personalized devices, and our OEM partners\\nare taking advantage of this. Over the last few months, they\\'ve delivered a breadth of differentiated\\ndevices designed to meet a wide range of customer needs. We\\'re encouraged by what we\\'ve been able to\\naccomplish with our partners, and collectively, we will continue to focus on driving the Windows ecosystem\\nforward.\\nNow let me share some perspective on what we saw in the PC market, which was slightly better than our\\nexpectation. Business PCs grew again for the third consecutive quarter and benefited from an improving\\nmacro environment, better availability of innovative new hardware and a refresh cycle ahead of Windows\\nXP end of support.\\nAdditionally, growth was higher in large enterprises than small- and medium-sized businesses. Consumer\\nPCs, while better than our expectations, continued to be soft as they faced challenges from competing\\nform factors. And as a general theme, developed markets outperformed emerging markets.\\nWindows continued to be the platform of choice for business. This quarter, Windows Pro revenue\\ngrew 12% and outpaced the underlying business PC market. This was driven by faster growth in both\\nenterprises and developed markets where Pro attach is higher. Windows non-Pro revenue, however, was\\ndown 20%, reflecting the dynamics of the consumer PC market.\\nNow let\\'s move to our Commercial business where key metrics remain strong. Bookings grew 12%\\nand renewal rates remained in line across our product portfolio, even with the large, expiring base in\\nthe quarter. Unearned revenue grew 12%, and our contracted not-billed balance is at a record level of\\nover $23 billion. To me, this is important as these long-term commitments demonstrate the confidence\\nthat customers have in our product roadmap, where we are investing in key areas such as Big Data,\\ninfrastructure management and cloud computing.\\nIn Big Data, our upcoming release of SQL Server 2014, builds on the momentum we\\'ve established.\\nOffering a complete business intelligence solution for Big Data, SQL Server is driving significant in-memory\\nperformance gains. Additionally, it enables hybrid cloud solutions with cloud backup and disaster recovery,\\nas well as providing enhanced availability and security.\\nHybrid infrastructure and management offerings also continue to be important priorities. Windows\\nServer, Azure and System Center are the centerpieces of our hybrid cloud strategy, and together, they\\nenable portability and scalability of workloads. Using our suite of products, customers get high-scale\\nvirtualization, built-in software-defined networking and hybrid business continuity that enable their\\nmodern data centers.\\nAs CIOs look to cloud computing to reduce costs and deliver business agility, they are turning to our cloud\\nservices. Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online offer customers the ability to transition easily to the cloud\\nand benefit from enterprise-class features and a familiar user interface. Additionally, Windows Azure\\nprovides the scalability and flexibility that addresses their evolving infrastructure and platform needs.\\nIn summary, we had a very good quarter across our Consumer and Commercial business. We are taking\\nshare with many products and seeing improvements in areas where we needed to be better. As we do this,\\nwe continue to prioritize the deployment of our resources to areas that accelerate innovation and deliver\\nproducts that our customers love.\\nWith that overview of the quarter, I\\'ll hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance\\nbefore I come back and share thoughts on our outlook.\\nChris Suh\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nGeneral Manager of Cloud & Enterprise Finance\\nThanks, Amy. First I\\'m going to review our overall results, and then I\\'ll move on to the details by reporting\\nsegment.\\nWe had a successful holiday quarter, and our broad, diversified portfolio helped us deliver record revenue\\nin Q2. Total revenue was up 11% to $24.5 billion, and without the impact of foreign exchange, revenue\\nwould have been higher by $196 million or 1 percentage point.\\nCost of goods sold increased 46%. This increase was primarily due to costs associated with the new Xbox\\nand Surface products, which launched this quarter, and also growth in cloud infrastructure supporting\\nour consumer and commercial offerings. Even as we invest in our devices and services initiatives, gross\\nmargin was flat at $16.2 billion.\\nOperating expenses grew 3%, which was below our guidance, as we continue to focus on prioritizing\\nspend towards strategic growth initiatives. Operating income and earnings per share both declined 4% to\\n$8.0 billion and $0.78, respectively.\\nThis quarter, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to shareholders in buybacks and dividends, our highest\\namount in the last 12 quarters.\\nI\\'m now going to talk through the performance of each of our reporting segments. In our Devices and\\nConsumer segment, revenue grew 13%. Within this, the licensing segment, which primarily includes\\nWindows OEM, Consumer Office and Windows Phone declined 6%, reflecting the overall PC and device\\nmarket trends.\\nWe continue to see similar dynamics to the previous quarter. Total Windows OEM revenue declined 3%.\\nAs Amy described, the 12% growth in Windows Pro was offset by 20% declines in Windows non-Pro.\\nExcluding the impact of China, where we continue to draw down inventory levels, Windows non-Pro\\nrevenue declined 14%.\\nOffice attach, including our cloud offerings, was up again this quarter. Traditional Consumer Office licensing\\nrevenue declined 24%. However, we estimate that approximately 16 percentage points of this decline\\nwas due to the shift to Office 365 Home Premium. Excluding this impact, traditional Consumer Office\\noutperformed the underlying consumer PC market.\\nNext, I\\'ll move to our Hardware segment, where revenue grew $1.9 billion or 68%, driven by a good\\nholiday quarter for our consumer devices. Xbox One had a record launch, and together with Xbox 360,\\nwe shipped 7.4 million consoles. For Surface, we saw improved sales of Surface RT and also introduced\\nSurface 2 and Surface Pro 2 into the market.\\nMoving to the Devices and Consumer Other segment. As a reminder, this segment includes our online\\nmarketplaces, advertising, Xbox Studios, Office 365 Home Premium and other consumer products and\\nservices. Revenue in this segment declined 10% when compared to last year when we launched Halo 4.\\nSearch advertising revenue grew 34%, driven by continued revenue per search improvement and query\\nvolume growth. Bing has now grown its share of search queries to 18.2% in the U.S.\\nOffice 365 Home Premium adoption continues to be strong. With this service, customers are always\\nrunning the most up-to-date version, have content available across their devices with SkyDrive integration\\nand get free Skype minutes. The overall value proposition is resonating well with customers and we\\nnow have more than 3.5 million subscribers. For the quarter, it accounted for more than 15% of total\\nConsumer Office licenses sold.\\nTurning now to our Commercial segment. All-up commercial revenue and gross margin across both on-\\npremise and cloud services grew 10%. Commercial Licensing segment, which reflects our traditional\\nsoftware licensing, grew 7%, and our Commercial Other segment, which captures our commercial cloud\\nservices, as well as our Enterprise Services business, grew 28% to $1.8 billion. As economies of scale\\nbenefits accrue to these Online Services, we\\'re seeing gross margin expansion in our Commercial Other\\nsegment.\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nWe saw continuing strength across our Commercial portfolio. Server product revenue grew 12%. In the\\nData Center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets Tier 1 application workloads, saw a\\nsignificant revenue growth again this quarter. Revenue for System Center grew double digits, and Hyper-V,\\nour virtualization product, gained 5 points this year over the last year.\\nIn our Data Platform business, SQL Server continued to outpace the market and revenue grew double\\ndigits, with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 25%. Our Commercial Office product also\\nremained strong, growing 10%. Within this, our productivity server offering, SharePoint, Exchange\\nand Lync continued to perform well, with Lync growing over 25%. We\\'re excited about the unified\\ncommunications opportunity as we combine the enterprise richness of Lync and the global reach of Skype\\nto transform the communications experience.\\nWe\\'re pleased with our momentum in cloud services. This quarter, revenue for commercial cloud services\\nagain grew over 100% as customers of all sizes continued to leverage our cloud services to improve\\nproductivity, reduce costs and leverage a secure and trusted platform. We are seeing broad-based\\nadoption as Office 365 seats, Azure customers and Dynamics CRM net seat adds all grew over 100%. We\\nnow have 70% of the Fortune 500 companies using at least one of our cloud services.\\nHaving now reviewed our results for this past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward-\\nlooking guidance.\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks, Chris. Before I get into our expectations for the quarter, let me quickly touch on Nokia. We\\ncontinue to expect that the deal will close this quarter but are still in the process of securing all regulatory\\napprovals and meeting closing conditions. So all guidance provided here assumes no impact from Nokia.\\nAssuming the deal closes this quarter, we will include Nokia in our guidance starting in the fourth quarter.\\nLooking ahead to the third quarter, we are expecting a similar macro environment to what we saw this\\nquarter. As such, many of the dynamics from the second quarter will likely continue into the third.\\nWith that, let\\'s get into the outlook, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue\\nto be $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the second quarter\\nwith business PCs growing, strong Pro mix and headwinds in consumer PCs. In Hardware, we expect\\nrevenue to be $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion. This reflects continued post-launch momentum with Surface\\n2, Surface Pro 2 and Xbox One, with the upcoming launch of the Xbox exclusive game, Titanfall. And in\\nDevices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion.\\nMoving on to Commercial. In what is a seasonally slower quarter, we are confident in our ability to\\ncontinue to be the vendor of choice with our productivity and infrastructure offerings. In Commercial\\nLicensing, we expect revenue to be $10.4 billion to $10.6 billion. In Commercial Other, we expect revenue\\nto be about $1.8 billion, reflecting continued momentum in our commercial cloud business. We expect\\nCOGS to be $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion next quarter. This range primarily reflects variability associated with\\nour Hardware business.\\nMoving on to operating expenses. We expect OpEx to grow 5% to 6% to $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion. We\\nare also reducing and narrowing the range for our full year guidance to $31.2 billion to $31.5 billion. As a\\nreminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and\\nthe net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We still expect our full year\\ntax rate to be between 18% and 20%.\\nWe now expect full year capital expenditures to be about $6 billion, which is down about $500 million\\nfrom our prior guidance. This reduction is primarily driven by improved capacity utilization and scale\\nbenefits as we converge our Online Services infrastructure platforms while continuing to support the\\nstrong demand that we see in business. Adjusting for prior year tech guarantees and product deferrals, we\\nexpect unearned revenue to sequentially decline, as it has in prior years.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

We are executing well across the\\ncompany as demonstrated by share gains in our commercial business, but we are also making important\\ninroads with our consumer offerings. Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about as we continue our\\ntransformation around One Microsoft.\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Chris, and we\\'ll take your questions.\\nChris Suh\\nGeneral Manager of Cloud & Enterprise Finance\\nThanks, Amy. And with that, we\\'ll move on to Q&A. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your\\ninstructions.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nQuestion and Answer\\n\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan Chase.\\nJohn Stephen DiFucci\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nObviously, nice upside in the Hardware business with Surface and Xbox. But my question is on the\\nlicensing business and so bear with me a little bit here. You had both licensing businesses, Device and\\nConsumer and Commercial Licensing. They were both better than expected, at least by about $100 million\\neach. At the same time, deferred revenue was shy by, I don\\'t know, something like $250 million. But\\nthere\\'s some conflicting things here. I\\'m just trying to get my head around this. The contracted, not billed,\\nAmy, you pointed out was really strong. It\\'s a big jump by somewhere around $2 billion sequentially. And\\nyou also saw some nice traction, the commercial cloud services more than doubled, assuming it\\'s small\\nbut -- so here\\'s my question. With all that happening, is there a shift happening with your on-premise\\ncorporate business to more transactional versus ratable contracts? That would sort of help out to help\\noffset the financial implications as you shift to sort of cloud services on the corporate side. Is that what\\'s\\nhappening with all these movements? Sorry about all the details.\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nI really appreciate the question because it\\'s going to let me help expand on a couple of dynamics, which\\nI think are at work here. So now I\\'m going to ask you to bear with me with a little bit of a long answer.\\nLet me start by your comments, I think, around the overall commercial licensing bucket. What I\\'m going\\nto expand to include as you did, the overall Commercial business, both cloud and licensing. There are a\\nnumber of metrics that I tend to look at together as opposed to individually to think about how we did in\\nthe quarter. You touched on, one, unearned, which grew 12% this quarter, which is quite good; the second\\nis bookings, which grew 12% in the quarter, which is very good; renewal rates, which were in line across\\nour products; and finally, the CNB balance, the contracted not billed balance, being up sequentially, $2\\nbillion, as you point out, is very big. If you think about those together as a group, those data points are\\nvery important because, together, I would say any -- I think you said a couple hundred short on unearned.\\nWith those data points together, I would say there\\'s no shortage in terms of Commercial Licensing and\\nCommercial Other strength all up. As you know, contracted but not billed tends to be at the end of a\\nquarter, right? We signed a bunch of contracts that we can\\'t bill for until the very beginning of the next.\\nThink about that as business done in quarter. You\\'ll see that come into the unearned balance, frankly, in\\nQ3, as well as into adjusted. So that dynamic answers, really, the first question and a part of the question\\nyou asked. Now that could have -- so that\\'s sort of a separate piece. Then you said, \"Well, some of the\\ndynamic could be explained by some strong transactional business in the quarter.\" I would say there\\'s one\\nplace, and I would actually separate these things because the first was good and the second was better\\nthan we thought. Office non-annuity or transactional did a little better than we thought in quarter as well,\\nand so that\\'s a good point that we didn\\'t bring out. But that is another, sort of, component of the 10% all-\\nup commercial growth. Now -- so I guess my answer is I agree with your transactional comment, but I\\ndisagree that it\\'s probably the overall -- it\\'s a component of a \"short fall in unearned\". I would say both\\nare actually quite good.\\nJohn Stephen DiFucci\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nThat\\'s fairly helpful, but actually, just a clarification on the contracted not yet billed. You said that -- and\\nyes, contracts get signed at the end of the quarter. But -- so you\\'re saying that the big jump, primarily,\\nwas because they just hadn\\'t been billed yet versus signing. I could see if you were just signing longer-\\nterm deals, that you\\'re going to build annually, but that\\'s not what\\'s happening. It\\'s more about just -- is\\nthat accurate? Either one could happen.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes, that\\'s right. If something was actually billed at the end of the quarter, it goes into unearned.\\nContracted but not billed is actually that the contract was signed but because the billing won\\'t quite\\ntake place until after the end of the fiscal quarter, it ends up in contracted but not billed as opposed to\\nunearned.\\nJohn Stephen DiFucci\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nRight. But are we seeing any -- like, typically, your contracts are 3 years, but are we seeing any extension\\non the average contract length?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nNo, no. That\\'s not one of the impacts.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford C. Bernstein.\\nMark L. Moerdler\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nTwo quick questions. The first one is, can you give us any sense of how much of the Office 365 and the\\nHome Premium could be generated by net new users as compared to simply the move over existing users?\\nAnd then I\\'ll ask a second one.\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nMark, that\\'s actually -- here\\'s how I think about the value prop because I can\\'t really say these are sales\\nthrough retail and through OEM, generally, whether it\\'s a net new user or not. What I can say is that\\nattach overall went up in the Office Consumer business, which I would say is and could be a sign that\\nsome of those are net new. And I would hope that to be the case. The value prop of Office 365 Home\\nPremium really does expand the footprint. It allows for multiple users. It has cross-platform capabilities\\nwith Office for Mac. It\\'s got mobile capabilities as well and allows for easier trial. So it does sort of lower\\nmany of the barriers to experience and try the products. So while I can\\'t point and say there\\'s an exact\\nnumber that is a new user, I can certainly say with attach going up, that dynamic is helpful.\\nMark L. Moerdler\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nExcellent. The second quick question on it -- the second quick question is on the Windows side. Any sense\\nwhether or not -- we\\'ve seen obviously an improvement on the numbers on here. Do you believe that\\'s\\nbeing driven purely by an improvement going on, on the market? Is the Windows 7 refresh accelerating\\nas we get closer to the day? Any sense of what the drivers are, both on the consumer and the enterprise\\nside, as to why we\\'re seeing the pickup?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nSure. I covered a little bit in my comments, but it\\'s probably worth spending a little bit more time. Let me\\nstart with the business market. I think there really are 3 factors that I would point to particularly in the\\nbusiness environment. And the first one may, Mark, also help on the consumer side. The overall macro\\nspending environment is better. It\\'s a little better than we thought. And in businesses, we\\'re seeing it --\\nyou\\'re seeing it in some of the IT spend forecasts you all put out. They\\'re being raised and I think that\\nhas an impact. The second is I think our partners have done a very good job expanding the types and\\navailability of new and interesting hardware. That brings people to the store and I think is encouraging\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

That is -- that has been an impact, and we expect\\nit to continue to be, as we said, in Q3. But I wouldn\\'t point to simply one of the factors as being the\\nreason, but it is a combination of those factors.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Crédit Suisse.\\nPhilip Alan Winslow\\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\\nI just have a question back on the Windows volume licensing side. You kind of touched on it earlier. But\\nyou saw a 10% growth this quarter versus 6% last quarter, so you continue to have very healthy growth\\nhere. One of the questions I\\'ve been getting from some clients is, a, what\\'s driving that; and b, when we\\nget -- as we get, sort of, closer and then actually pass the official end of life of XP, how do you think that\\'s\\ngoing to affect the growth in Windows licensing sort of beyond that point?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks, Phil. Let me -- I\\'m going to take the opportunity to make your question 2 questions. One is to\\ntalk about Windows volume licensing overall and, secondly, allow me to talk a little bit about the places\\nthat you could see the impact of Windows XP in the current quarter, and I think that will help as you think\\nabout Q3 going forward. In volume licensing, you\\'re right, it did grow 10% in Q2. And we do believe we\\nare seeing some of the benefits of that growth is the end of life of Windows XP. But it\\'s also reflective of\\nthe value many of our bigger customers are seeing in upgrading to the enterprise version of Windows. The\\nenterprise SKU includes things like DirectAccess, Windows To Go, the corporate image, AppLocker. And\\nthose really are differentiating, and they really do matter to many CIOs. So I think specifically on VL, while\\nend of life of XP is one component, it\\'s certainly not the only component. Now if I expand your question\\nto sort of -- and I think, in a way, John asked about it, too -- I mean, Mark asked about it, too, is the end\\nof life of XP. One place that we\\'ve talked about it was Windows and how does it play in to the business PC\\ngrowth; the second we talked about was volume licensing; and the third, which I actually talked about\\nin John\\'s question, was Office and some transactional strengths. Some of the strengths that we saw in\\nOffice transactionally really can be linked back to the end of life of XP. As people refresh a PC and if they\\'re\\nbuying Pro, those people often are Office customers. And so if they tend to buy on a transactional basis,\\nthey\\'d also see some impact through Office. I think you can tie that back to some of the outperformance\\nwe saw in the quarter as well.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\\nHeather Anne Bellini\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\\nAmy, I wanted to ask if you could share with us how you see the gross margin profile of the company\\nchanging as you continue with your journey to be a devices and services company. And as you look out to\\nwhen the transition is complete, and I know you probably don\\'t know when exactly that\\'s going to occur,\\nhow do we think about what it will look like?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nHeather, thanks. This is one of those questions that I think is best taken in a bit of a chunk. First of all, I\\nthink if you look at our Commercial segment, I\\'ll do it all up because I think it\\'s relatively easy with that\\nbreakdown. In general, and you saw it this quarter, even if we continue to invest in the infrastructure to\\nsupport our cloud conversion of our commercial customers to Azure and Office 365 and CRM Online, our\\nactual gross margin remains flat, which means we\\'re increasing our utilization and growing gross margin\\nin the commercial cloud business as we continue to see traction. Over time, I continue to believe our\\nCommercial business, in the absolute, moving to the cloud is a net positive, as we talked about before, to\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\noverall profit, including increasing the amount of gross margin we make as a company. So that -- I think\\nthis quarter was 83%-ish, so that, I would take as a separate bucket from our Devices and Consumer\\nbusiness. And now what\\'s interesting is we have a couple of business models there with different gross\\nmargin profiles. And you\\'re actually seeing the impact of some of that in this quarter. Xbox, as we know,\\nespecially with new consoles like the One, tend to be gross, margin-negative on the front. This is a heavy\\nquarter for that. Over time, through the attach, a second -- first-, second-, third-party games and other\\nservices, the margin profile with any console life changes. But it\\'s never going to be an 83% gross margin.\\nIt\\'s just a different business, even for the market leader and even successfully generating cash in return.\\nThat is different from other businesses we also have in D&C. So I think the important thing that I tend\\nto focus on as I go through all these businesses is continued margin improvement within the business,\\ncontinued efficiency within the business and continued focus on the absolute profit within each of those\\nareas. And then the mix then becomes more of a math equation as we continue to grow the overall\\namount of cash and profit the company generates.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.\\nBrent John Thill\\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\\nAmy, just back on contracted not billed. You had 4 quarters over $21 billion and then jumping up obviously\\nto north of $23 billion. That jump that happened, can you just help us understand what the buckets of --\\nthat made that jump up this quarter. Was -- is there an easier way to think through where that actually\\ncame from?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes. Yes and no, of course. Brent, let me say, contractual -- contracted but not billed is related to the\\nnumber of expirations we have in the quarter. Chris and, I think, I both talked about, we did have a lot of\\nexpirations in the quarter. When those tend to fall at the end, it can impact the actual magnitude is the\\nabsolute number of expirations. And then that timing of when those fall in the quarter can also impact\\nhow it\\'s recognized. And that\\'s why I never really look at it separately from unearned, bookings and\\nrenewals together. And so -- because timing is one thing, that\\'s why I tend to put them in a bucket and\\nsay together, it\\'s a good and healthy trajectory.\\nBrent John Thill\\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\\nAnd just real quick, on the multi-year agreements, you mentioned the healthy renewals. Any color you\\ncan add to the re-up on the size of what you\\'re seeing in general across some of those bigger multi-year\\nagreements?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nI think in general, it reflects the same trends we\\'ve been seeing. It\\'s across our broad portfolio. You see it\\nwith -- across Windows, Office and Server. If you look at our KPIs, I think that points out that it\\'s pretty\\nbroad-based. So I don\\'t think there\\'s any one particular area I would call out. It\\'s really more about\\nplatform health and commitment.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.\\nWalter H Pritchard\\nCitigroup Inc, Research Division\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nQuestion on the consumer retail side. This is the first year, I think, you\\'ve had full retail store presence.\\nYou also, I believe, had some presence in some of the Best Buys with sort of mini stores in there. And I\\'m\\nwondering sort of what your takeaway is from the holiday season, and if those efforts, you think, were\\npart of the reason why you had a pretty successful holiday season, especially on the PC side and what\\nthat experience suggests that you should do in the future in terms of retail store buildout and general\\ninvestment around retail.\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks, Walter. When we talk about improved retail execution, I really think that\\'s a partnership, as you\\nsaid, with retailers, with our OEMs and with our efforts to really improve both the devices, the assortment\\nand the experience of buying in the PC aisle. So I do feel good about the investments we\\'ve made there,\\nand we\\'ve made them, I think, thoughtfully and continue to keep a focus on cost and expense as we do\\nthat. So do I think it\\'s had an impact? I do. But I really think the broader impact was investments and\\ncommitments we had with our partners to also improve the retail buying experience.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\\nKeith Weiss\\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\\nI wanted to dig into gross margins in the quarter because by my estimates, you guys outperformed\\nthe guidance for gross margin that you gave in the quarter. Despite the fact that you saw significant\\noutperformance in D&C Hardware, which, as you were saying, especially for something like Xbox One,\\nwhich is just out of the gate, we had expectations of being very low, if not negative gross margins. Can\\nyou help us understand a little bit of where that gross margin outperformance came from? Was any of\\nit in D&C Hardware getting better yields or, sort of, better gross margins on those products than your\\nexpectations? And if not, where did the outperformance come from?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks, Keith. I\\'m glad you asked that question. With our outperformance, as you pointed out, in D&C\\nHardware, we did actually see increased COGS related to that. However, that was offset by some COGS\\nimprovement and savings we saw across other areas as we continue to focus on efficiency and execution.\\nAnd so you\\'re right, we did see COGS grow with Hardware, but we were able to find savings elsewhere as\\nwe focused on improved execution.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.\\nRichard G. Sherlund\\nNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\\nJust a follow-up to an earlier question on the contracted but unbilled. We\\'re seeing with VMware that\\nthey had a surge of 3-year contracts coming out of the recession, and a lot of those were coming back\\nfor renewal now. Is that what you were suggesting as you\\'ve got an unusually large volume of contracts\\ncoming up for renewal?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nRick, that\\'s a yes. In many ways, you\\'ve seen this over covering our company for a while. Expirations can\\nbe chunkier. That\\'s not a year statement. This quarter, we had a big expiry base. I wouldn\\'t characterize\\nit as sort of abnormally large, but the timing is a bit related to 3 years ago and the timing of some of the\\ncontracts. So it\\'s probably a consistent driver.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nRichard G. Sherlund\\nNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\\nOkay. And last quarter, we talked a bit about -- are there any metrics you can help us to understand better\\nwhat the effect of your revenues is from the shift to the cloud? I think on Office, it\\'s more of a net delta\\nthat I think you\\'d said it hurts you about $150 million in the previous quarter. Is there any way you can\\ngive us a sense of what the net impact is on the business from the shift to the cloud?\\nChris Suh\\nGeneral Manager of Cloud & Enterprise Finance\\nRick, it\\'s Chris. I think I talked about this a little bit. The place where you can see the most direct impact\\nis in the Consumer Office business. We talked about the business on a traditional license basis being down\\n24 points, but our estimate is approximately 16 points of that decline is accounted for by the shift to Office\\n365 Home Premium. So that gives you sort of a good estimation of the impact -- the direct impact we\\'re\\nseeing, particularly on the consumer side.\\nRichard G. Sherlund\\nNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\\nThat implies it would only be down about 8% were it not for the shift to the cloud?\\nChris Suh\\nGeneral Manager of Cloud & Enterprise Finance\\nThat\\'s one way to look at it, yes. The net number would be about 8%.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA.\\nEdward Everett Maguire\\nCLSA Limited, Research Division\\nI wanted to ask about Phone because you had not discussed Windows Phone on the call so far. Just how\\nit\\'s tracking based on your expectations, whether you are planning on continuing to invest with non-Nokia\\nOEMs, and also, Amy, whether any of your expectations or investment plans for the integration with Nokia\\nhave changed in any meaningful way since you announced the deal.\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks, Ed. That\\'s a good point. We didn\\'t have a chance to discuss the Phone results. We did see growth\\nin Windows Phone, both in the licensing and in the mobile phone IP revenues. Both grew this quarter.\\nI think regarding Nokia, we continue to see the growth in many places that we\\'ve seen historically: so\\nunsubsidized markets, as well as with entry-level smartphone devices. So I think many of those dynamics\\nhaven\\'t really changed. Do I have any updates to how to think about Nokia other than we continue to\\nexpect it to close in the quarter? I don\\'t. We mostly remain focused on working hard to get to the point.\\nWe\\'re working together as 1 team to drive that business forward.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\\nKasthuri Gopalan Rangan\\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\\nAmy, I appreciate the fact that you\\'re trying to improve the margins in each of the Commercial and the\\nConsumer businesses. But the margin differential between these 2 businesses is still is a pretty wide one.\\nIt looks like the Consumer business is growing. The 2 dynamics that I can see are that the Consumer\\nbusiness -- the 3 are [ph] : one is the margin differential is too wide. You try to improve it. The margin\\ndifferential is still wide. The Consumer business, trend-wise, is growing faster than commercial. And third\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nis that you have the shift to the cloud. So unless you do something like an Adobe or Autodesk where\\nyou force the transition to happen very quickly, there is the risk that you get a lot of growth, which is\\nfantastic, and there\\'s a lot of progress to share. But the margin inflection point could be delayed for\\nseveral years, so I think that was one of the questions, that was the spur behind, I think, presumably,\\nHeather\\'s question. That\\'s what I\\'m trying to get at. So how long are you going to get this shift to result in\\na way that we may not see the earnings growth rate but we may have to wait until some point in time? Or\\nare you at the point where you can actually force this shift to happen much quicker?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks, Kash. I think the way I think about it is we are -- we have a broad portfolio, and we address\\ncustomers of all types. And in many ways, our biggest goal is to meet the needs of our customers,\\nwhether they be CIOs or consumers, and setting our business model to support the products, and the\\nadoption curve that we want needs to be married with the adoption curve and timing of our customers.\\nI feel like we\\'ve done a very good job of balancing the pace of that. I\\'ve been encouraged by the pace of\\nadoption of many of our cloud services. You heard the Home Premium numbers today, as well as talking\\nabout the commercial cloud. And so for me, it\\'s hard to say -- they\\'re too big of a delta. It\\'s really about\\nmanaging each of these things toward absolute growth and absolute improvement and having customer\\nadoption. So I probably just have a different perspective on that than you have.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.\\nRoss Stuart MacMillan\\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\\nAmy, you said that Office 365 Home Premium was more than 15% of total Consumer Office licenses sold.\\nAnd I wonder, if you think about your Commercial business and we either think about it as a percentage of\\ntotal Office 365 or as a percentage of maybe what\\'s traditionally being transactional, whether you have a\\nsimilar metric in terms of percentage of total Office licenses sold.\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nIt\\'s actually -- it\\'s a good question. We only recently started selling the Office client in our volume\\nlicensing agreements through a subscription. So that is actually good feedback for us to think going\\nforward about talking about the Office-specific business that way because, in general, we think of Office\\n365 as being a broad set of assets, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Office in the Commercial\\nbusiness. And we haven\\'t really talked about it, given the newness of the model in the enterprise as being\\nas meaningful as it has been in the consumer. The shift is far faster there on the client.\\nRoss Stuart MacMillan\\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\\nYes, I just think that would be helpful, especially if you think about it with respect to your traditional\\ncommercial transactional business. Maybe if I could slip in one other one, just to go back on the\\ncontracted not billed. I just want to be clear in my own mind because I\\'ve heard 2 things. One thing I\\nheard you say was we had stronger transactional business late in the quarter, but I also heard you say\\nthat there were, frankly, more renewals on multi-year that would have resulted in that balance going up,\\nespecially if those were late in the quarter. So am I right to think it\\'s those 2 factors that are at play here,\\nboth stronger transactional and a larger pool, if you will, of multi-year renewals? And is it relatively evenly\\nbalanced between the 2?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks. Actually, transactional execution in the quarter is recognized all in quarter. That\\'s not annuity. It\\ndoesn\\'t go to either the unearned balance or the contracted not billed balance. So that\\'s not an impact\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nthat results in a change to your unearned or CNB. The latter, which is the absolute size of the expiration\\ndays, frankly, could or couldn\\'t impact CNB. It can impact things like unearned growth, but it also can\\nimpact CNB, depending on if it\\'s contracted and quartered but not billed until after the end of the quarter.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.\\nBrad Robert Reback\\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\\nSo, Amy, in the Q, you talked about the Surface still losing money even at the almost $900 million run rate\\nof revenue in the quarter. Can you give us any sense of what type of volume you need for that business to\\nhave the scale to make some money?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks, Brad. When we launched Surface just a year ago, our goal was really to create a product that\\nshowcased what can happen when you innovate in hardware, in the service and in the software. And as\\nyou know, we\\'ve learned a lot over the course of this journey, and we have to make more meaningful\\nprogress. But I think for us, we\\'ve remained focused as we launch the second version of Surface to be --\\nto stay focused on those price points and gross margin. And I think we\\'ve made a big leap from B1 to B2,\\nand I look forward to making leaps as we go forward in our product roadmap. But I do think it\\'s more to\\nthink about it as a goal we absolutely have as we continue to innovate the line.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.\\nGregg Steven Moskowitz\\nCowen and Company, LLC, Research Division\\nAmy, despite the healthy gross margins, your Xbox platform revenue grew $1.2 billion year-over-year,\\nbut your related cost of goods sold went up by $1.6 billion. And I realize there may be additional costs\\nrelated to launch, but just wondering if you could talk to your expected profitability levels for Xbox over\\nthe balance of fiscal \\'14.\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks. We\\'ll continue to be in launch mode for Xbox One, especially many people are excited about the\\nlaunch of Titanfall in March. And we\\'ll continue to add and expand markets over the course of the year.\\nSo I would continue to think about our investments in being the leading next-generation console certainly\\nextending.\\nOperator\\nAnd our last question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.\\nBrendan John Barnicle\\nPacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division\\nAmy, you mentioned briefly in your comment some of the strengths you\\'d seen in SQL Server, and that\\nseems to be taking market share. You highlighted a couple of the features, but what do you think is\\ndriving that market share gain? And a similar question over on the Server side, where you seem to have\\nbetter server numbers than what we\\'ve seen in units. What would be accounting for that additional\\nstrength?\\nAmy E. Hood\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cMICROSOFT CORPORATION FQ2 2014 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2014\\n\\nThank you. You\\'re right, I only pointed out a few of the value props of SQL Server. And actually, dating\\nback years, the real value prop of SQL has been the breadth of its offering: analytics, reporting and core\\ndatabase functionality. And so over the years, I think the balance of those things and continuing to add\\nand innovate at very good value has continued to be appealing. And I -- as we move forward and add\\nsome cloud capabilities into our hybrid model and continue to add features into the premium levels, when\\nyou\\'re the established, and I think in many ways, unit leader, then you can focus on continuing to move\\nup the stack, adding value and increasing your premium mix. And the team has really done a terrific job\\nof doing that. So it\\'s nice to be asked so that I can talk about it. And I think, I mentioned it briefly, that\\nSystem Center is another where we\\'ve gained share in virtualization. And I think we\\'re quite proud of\\nthe progress we\\'ve made, especially in that area, and that\\'s enabled a lot of growth as well. So I actually\\nappreciate the question. It\\'s good to be able to talk so positively about those assets.\\nChris Suh\\nGeneral Manager of Cloud & Enterprise Finance\\nOkay. So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today\\'s earnings call.
